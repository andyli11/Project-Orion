# Project-Orion

I tried my best to learn Node, React, and PostgreSQL for this project but I could not pick up those languages in the given timespan. So, I knew that the best option was to focus on exhibit C and go back to HTML/CSS/Javascript. Although there is very limited back-end design, I will continue watching tutorials to learn and improve my skills everyday.

All in all, I want to thank you for this oppertunity. It taught me a lot about the full stack position and as a first year, I understand that there are a lot of things that I need to improve on. However, all in all, this project was very fun and by far, the most challenging thing I have ever come across. 

Once again, thank you giving me this activity. 

Have a great day.
